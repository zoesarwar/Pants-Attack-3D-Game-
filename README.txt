Operating Notes For Built Game:
* The player navigates around the town trying to kill the attacking jeans before the 
* Jeans spawn randomly around the town.
* The left and right arrows will point you in the corresponding direction, the forward arrow will move you forward. The space bar will shoot bullets out of the cannon. 
* The objective is to kill a certain number of jeans in a limited amount of time.
* The countdown timer is displayed in the top right and the number of jeans you need to shoot is in the top left corner. Everytime you shoot a pair of jeans, it will decrement by one giving you an accurate inventory of pants to kill.
* Game ends if the time runs out and you were unable to kill the desired number of pants.
* If you succeed in killing the desired number of pants in the time allocated for you, you level up and the time-to-jeans ratio shrinks.
